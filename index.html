    You can use this file as a starting point for any HTML page that you want to
    create.
    
    This is a comment. Comments will not be displayed in the browser. A comment 
    can go over one or multiple lines.

    Use the !DOCTYPE declaration to explicitly tell the browser receiving this 
    file that it is an HMTL file. A DOCTYPE associates a particular document
    with a document type definition (DTD), for example, the formal definition of
    a particular version of HTML 2.0 - 4.0. The HTML layout engines in modern 
    web browsers perform DOCTYPE "sniffing" or "switching", wherein the DOCTYPE 
    in a document determines a layout mode, such as "quirks mode" (for 
    compatibility) or "standards mode" (for compliance with current standards). 
    The DOCTYPE is retained in HTML5 as a "mostly useless, but required" header 
    only to trigger "standards mode" in common browsers.
-->
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!--
    After the DOCTYPE, the html document begins as is indicated by the html 
    root element. You can think of your entire html document as a tree and 
    the html element as the root from which everything else sprouts.
    
    The language attribute is used by web search engines to display search 
    results in a particular language. E.g. if you are using Google in the US, 
    you will not see many French pages returned in your results.

    The head section has all the meta information, i.e., information about our 
    website that will not be displayed to the user. It tells browsers and search 
    engines basic information about the page such as the title, the charset, etc.
-->
<head>
    <!--
        No end tag is required for meta and link elements. That is the case 
        because they are non-XHTML tags. Help the browser understand what 
        characters to render by specifying a character set.

        The title is important for search engine optimization (SEO). It will be 
        visible to the user in the tab in which the site is opened. Titles 
        should be unique.

    <!--
        You could apply CSS styles in-line, i.e., in your HTML files, as follows:

        <style>
            p{color:red;}
        </style>

        This style would turn all font in paragraphs red. Generally, it is a 
        good idea to use a dedicated Style Sheet to have all styles 
        systematically in one place and not duplicate those. Include a link as 
        below in any HTML page where you want to use styles from your Style 
        Sheet.

        You can have multiple Style Sheets; the browser would use all.

        Just as CSS styles, you can also include JavaScript code in-line in your
        HTML files using the <script> and </script? opening and closing tags.
        Place CSS styles/links in the header and JavaScript code/links before the 
        closing </body> tag. The reason for having Style Sheets in the header is
        that otherwise browsers would need to reflow the layout while the user 
        is trying to interact with the page. If you would not have JavaScript 
        at the end, browsers in some cases would have to block processing 
        the HTML while JavaScript code is still being loaded.

    The body holds all content that is visible to the user and it determines 
    the structure of your page.

    <!-- 
        Everything between two tags, including the tags, is an element. Headings
        come in six different sizes: <h1></h1> to <h6></h6>. Note that 
        it is not possible to autonumber headings in HTML. You would need to 
        write such functionality yourself.
