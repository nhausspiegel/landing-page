    <h1>Is It A 10?: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>This is a music rating website. Why are you confused? Didn't you search for this?</p>

    <h2>Who's Anthony Fantano?</h2>
    <p>
        Anthony Fantano (born October 28, 1985) is an American music critic and YouTuber 
        who runs the YouTube channel The Needle Drop and its tie-in website.
        You can thank Wikipedia for that one.

    <h2>Why can I give albums flannels?</h2>
    <p>
        Fantano is widely known to reserve certain flannel shirts for specific album
        scores: yellow for a "good" album, red for a "bad" album. Every color and
        pattern past that is less strictly coded, but we've included a bunch anyway.
        You can observe the melon's scoring habits and try to follow his tendencies
        exactly, <i>or</i> you can make up your own system and essentially use the 
        different colors of flannel as flairs or indicators for categories that you
        come up with. That's what we recommend!
